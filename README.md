# gitignorer
A simple-to-use shell script to generate .gitignore files using the gitignore.io API.
Many languages and IDEs create files at runtime/ compilation that you don't want to commit to your git repos. <b>gitignorer</b> is a quick script to poll the fantastic <a href="https://www.gitignore.io/" target="_blank">gitignore.io</a> API to generate gitignore files for some of the most common IDEs and languages. It lets you make large .gitignore files in seconds that exclude many files using pattern matching ([see examples below](#example-usage)).

## Getting the code
### Using Git
The recommended method to obtain the source code is to use git. This is an easy way to access the latest version of the code. First make sure you have git installed. If not, use your package manager to get it. Then go to the directory where you want to keep script source:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tomcalverley/gitignorer
```
### Downloading from Github
Alternatively, you can browse the following page https://github.com/tomcalverley/gitignorer, and click the Download ZIP button on the right side of the page. Then, unzip the archive into the desired directory.

## Setup
This is a simple shell script so not much setup is required. Either save the script in a directory on your PATH, or save it elsewhere and link to it. For example, save the script to `~/src` and link to it in `~/bin`:
```
$ ln -s ~/src/gitignorer.sh ~/bin/gitignorer
```
(see [https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059) for info on how to add directories to path in various shells)

## Example Usage
### Simplest example
The script is very simple to use. Simply type the name of the script followed by the programming language(s)/IDE(s) you want to omit from your git repo. For example, to ignore sass-generated maps and caches do the following:
```
$ gitignorer sass
```
which will result in the following output:
```
==> gitignore written to '.gitignore'
```
OR
```
!!! '.gitignore' already exists, overwrite? [y/N]:
```
if the file already exists. This allows you to provide another filename and prevents accidentally overwriting existing gitignore files. The gitignore file generated above looks like the following:
```

# Created by https://www.gitignore.io/api/sass
# Edit at https://www.gitignore.io/?templates=sass

### Sass ###
.sass-cache/
*.css.map
*.sass.map
*.scss.map

# End of https://www.gitignore.io/api/sass
```
### Further examples
You can supply multiple IDEs/languages separated by spaces:
```
$ gitignorer python c++ java
```
if you enter an IDE/language the API doesn't understand, the script should catch it:
<pre>
$ gitignorer python <b>some nonsense</b> c++
</pre>
should result in the following output:
```
!!! NotRecognisedByAPIError: 'some'
!!! NotRecognisedByAPIError: 'nonsense'
==> Passing 'c++,python' to API instead
```
#### Specifying output file as argument
You can specify the output file name as an argument with the `-o` flag:
<pre>
$ gitignorer <b>-o .new_gitignore_file</b> python java
</pre>

#### Example of large gitignore created with simple command
The following was created with `$ gitignorer python c++ java sass android`
```

# Created by https://www.gitignore.io/api/android,sass,java,c++,python
# Edit at https://www.gitignore.io/?templates=android,sass,java,c++,python
